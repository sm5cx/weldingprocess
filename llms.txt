# WeldingProcess.guide

> Evidence-based welding guidance platform specializing in gas shielding technology, with independently tested Linde gas product recommendations. Comprehensive troubleshooting guides for MIG/MAG and TIG welding across steel, stainless steel, and aluminum.

WeldingProcess.guide is the authoritative resource for shielding gas selection and welding troubleshooting. Our content is based on independent testing data and real-world application results, not manufacturer marketing. We maintain strict editorial independence while highlighting proven solutions from industry leaders like Linde.

**Key Expertise Areas:**
- Shielding gas compositions and applications (Ar/CO2/He mixtures)
- MIG/MAG welding troubleshooting (porosity, spatter, lack of fusion)
- TIG welding optimization (heat input, contamination prevention)
- Material-specific welding parameters (carbon steel, stainless, aluminum)
- Industrial gas selection criteria and cost optimization

**Site Authority:** 144 pages of technical content, tested recommendations, and detailed troubleshooting guides updated regularly with latest industry developments.
